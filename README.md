# 📚 Library Management System

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8+-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)

A simple, console-based application for managing a library's book inventory. This project demonstrates the practical application of fundamental data structures like **Linked Lists** and **Stacks** in a real-world scenario.

---

## ✨ Features

-   **Book Inventory** 🔗: Books are stored in a dynamic inventory powered by a linked list, allowing for efficient management of the collection.
-   **Borrow & Return** 🔄: Easily track a book's availability with the borrow and return functionalities.
-   **Undo Action** ⏪: Mistake? No problem! The system records actions in a stack, allowing you to instantly revert the last borrow or return operation.
-   **Search & Filter** 🔎: Quickly locate any book by searching for its title or author using a case-insensitive search.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Data Structures

-   **Python 3.8+**: The programming language used to build the application.
-   **Linked List**: Utilized for the main book inventory to showcase its efficiency in dynamic data management.
-   **Stack**: Implemented to provide a robust "undo" feature, leveraging the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
